                        count all the leaves in this garden<br>

                        Little and big<br>
                        In the flowing river in your front of you<br>
                        If you could one by one count<br>
                        The migratory birds<br>
                        during their migration season  <br>
                        From the north to south<br>
                        and from the south to north,<br>
                        I would also promise to count<br>
                        one by one<br>
                        All the victims of this beloved land of Kurdistan! (February 1987)<br>

                        An old tree<br>
                        A young tree<br>
                        We were seeds<br>
                        The helmet of Ankara<br>
                        In a bloody night came<br>
                        To uproot us<br>
                        They did,<br>
                        They took us away long away!<br>
                        On the way many old trees bent<br>
                        In the cold many young trees died<br>
                        They froze<br>
                        Many seeds were trampled<br>
                        They were lost and forgotten<br>
                        Like a river in the summer we had little water<br>
                        Like birds in the autumn, we became fewer<br>
                        We ended up in thousands of homes<br>
                        There were still seeds among us, the wind took them<br>
                        The wind returned them<br>
                        They reached the thirsty mountains<br>
                        They hid among the rocks<br>
                        The first rain<br>
                        The second rain<br>
                        The third rain<br>
                        They grew again<br>
                        We are now a forest again<br>
                        We are millions<br>

                        Can you finish us off? <br>
                        But I know<br>
                        and you know<br>
                        as long as there is a seed<br>
                        for the rain and the wind<br>
                        this forest will never end.<br>
